# Introduction to GitHub Projects

### What is GitHub Projects?
GitHub Projects is a generic project management tool built into GitHub.
It allows you to:
* Plan and track work directly next to your code
* Organize issues, pull requests, and notes into customizable views
Visualize progress using boards, tables, and timelines

* Ideal for Agile, Kanban, Scrum, or hybrid workflows.
Think of it as Trello + Jira inside GitHub

### Key concepts and views
* Issues: Trackable items, such as tasks, bugs, or feature requests
* Pull Requests (PRs): Code changes linked to issues
* Projects: Collections of issues/PRs organized for tracking progress
* Fields: Custom metadata like status, priority, sprint, etc.

### Issues
* An Issue is an abstract concept (a “card”) that can be used in scrum, for example, to describe user stories and tasks
* Issues are tied to the repository they are created in. This means that issue #1 in Repository A is completely independent of issue #1 in Repository B.
* Team members can
  * comment on issues,
  * assign them to specific people (assignees)
  * add labels for better organization
  * associate them with milestones
* Issues can be placed in scrum-board columns in the GitHub Project board, and moved
* Issues can be closed (Close), reopened (Reopen) and deleted
